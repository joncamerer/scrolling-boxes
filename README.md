## Scrolling Boxes

Scrolling Boxes is a playground to test out various scrolling techniques in Single-Page Applications. 

Using only Vue.js and CSS flexbox, the goal was to layout several scrolling lists which would dynamically size and resize themselves to fit the user's screen. The main list uses an infinite scroll and has an input which allows the user to select how many boxes to generate at a time as well as updating the user as to how many total boxes have been generated. The other lists require user input to load additional items and are built to function as sidebar components.
